# Antagonist:
//Nutmeg: Gets fostered with a mean, sassy cat who hogs all of the attention

### Ria, this has nothing to do with Cardamom, also, I think we should talkk about it before we write anything permanent.  Also, I put // before what you wrote to clarify that it was only an idea. P.S you can delete this after u read it.  P.P.S thats not saying WHO the antagonist is.
