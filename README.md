# Antagonist:
     Pepper, a foster cat who is annoying and bossy. Sulivan, the old cat who lives in the forest.

# Problem:
Nutmeg and Cardamom get fostered with Pepper for two months. Nutmeg and Cardamoms' mother leaves and never return so they have to figure out how to survive in the wild. 
## --------------------
# Location:
Different foster homes, the forest behind Lidia's house, (Who's Lidia?)


## Here we both will write about a paragraph of our story ideas, then we will decide on one to use. (or a new one.)

## Ria's Story:




was pouncing on Cardamom's yarn balls and messing up her mossy bed.
    "Nutmeg!" Cardamom ran back into her room and started chasing Nutmeg around and around and around, until they were both resting on the floor, catching their breath and staring at the mess they had created.
    Their mom walked in, shaking her head at the mess, "You silly kittens! Now both of you will have to clean up Cardamom's room all over again!"

## Becky's Story:
    Welcome reader, into our magical forest. You may be wondering how we got here, its a long story.  But, I suppose we do have time.  Come, come join us, reader. Sit down in the old rocking chair and listen as we tell our story.
    It all started many years ago, in Whisperer's Hollow . .. 
    "Stop it!" 
    "No, you stop!"
    "Mom, Nutmeg's in my room again!"
    "Girls-" Nutmeg pounced, I ducked. My mom had jst gotten up the stairs but wasnt qick enough to move out of the way. 
    "Mom!"
Once i realized what was happening it was too late, i tried switching directions but i couldnt, I was heading straight for my mother!
